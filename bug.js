While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the expo-updates package.  The error message was vague and unhelpful, mentioning issues with the update manifest but lacking specific details. I tried clearing the cache, reinstalling packages, and checking my network connection, but none of these resolved the issue. The error consistently occurred when I attempted to check for updates, even with a simple app.
