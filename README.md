# Expo Updates Package Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo updates package. The error message is vague and unhelpful, making debugging challenging.  The bug prevents the application from successfully checking for updates.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `expo start`.
4. Attempt to check for updates (e.g., through the Expo Go app or by programmatically checking for updates within the application). The error should occur.

## Expected Behavior

The application should successfully check for updates and report whether an update is available or not.

## Actual Behavior

The application encounters an error related to the update manifest, but the message is insufficient to identify the root cause.

## Solution

A solution is included (see `bugSolution.js`) that shows the steps to fix the error.  The resolution may involve updating the expo-updates package, cleaning up the build process, or inspecting the server response for clues.

## Additional Notes

This bug might be related to issues with the remote update server, network configuration, or inconsistencies in the manifest file itself.
