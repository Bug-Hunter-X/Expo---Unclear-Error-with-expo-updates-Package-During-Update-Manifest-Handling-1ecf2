The solution involved several steps: 
1. **Checking the Expo Updates Server:** Ensured the server hosting the updates was accessible and functioning correctly. In some cases, issues on the server-side can lead to manifest retrieval failures. 
2. **Inspecting the manifest file:** Verified the `manifest.json` file generated during the build process for any errors or inconsistencies in the content. 
3. **Cleaning the build and cache:**  Ran `expo prebuild --clean` and cleared the cache of the app using the `expo prebuild --clean` command. 
4. **Package Updates:** Updated the expo-updates package to the latest stable version. 
5. **Network Configuration:** Checked network connectivity and ensured that the app has necessary permissions. 
By systematically investigating each aspect, the root cause of the manifest failure could be identified.  Once fixed, the app was able to check for updates without errors.
